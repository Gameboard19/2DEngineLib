# Actors
Actors are a primary part of how this .lib functions. Actors are any kind of object that can interact with other objects and I currently plan for 4 different ones.
## Actor Types
### Entity
Use the Entity subclass for any Actor you intend to function as a player, enemy, ally, or similar.
### Object
An object may be used for anything you would like to serve as objects in the environment. these can include Powerups, Crates, or anything similar to that.
### Projectile
If you want to have something shoot at something else, you would want to use a projectile.
### Terrain
Can be anything from an obstacle your player has to navigate around, to a platform they need to jump on.
